# ‚≠ê RateMate

**RateMate** is a lightweight and customizable Android rating bar that allows you to define:
- Custom icons for **rated** and **unrated** stars
- Optionally different icons for the **last star** in both states

Perfect for apps that want more visual control over their rating UI than what the default `RatingBar` offers.
